Add multicurrency support to WooCommerce, allowing you set product's prices in multiple currencies based on country of your site's visitor.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Price Based on Country** is a extension for WooCommerce that allows you to sell the same product in multiple currencies based on the country of the customer. 

= How it works =

The plugin detects automatically the country of the website visitor throught the geolocation feature included in WooCommerce (2.3.0 or later) and display the currency and price you have defined previously for this country. 

You have two ways to set product's price for each country:

* Calculate price by applying a exchange rate.
* Set price manually.

When country changes on checkout page, the cart, the order preview and all shop are updated to display the correct currency and pricing.

= Multicurrency = 
Sell and receive payments in different currencies, reducing the costs of currency conversions.

= Country Switcher =
The extension include a country switcher widget to allow your customer change the country from the frontend of your website.

= Shipping currency conversion =
Apply currency conversion to Flat and International Flat Rate Shipping.

= Compatible with WPML =
WooCommerce Product Price Based on Countries is officially compatible with [WPML](https://wpml.org/extensions/woocommerce-product-price-based-countries/).
