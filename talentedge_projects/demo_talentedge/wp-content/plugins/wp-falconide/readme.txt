The Falconide plugin uses SMTP or API integration to send outgoing emails from your WordPress installation. It replaces the wp_mail function included with WordPress.

To have the Falconide plugin running after you have activated it, go to the plugin's settings page and set Falconide SMTP and API credentials.

You can also set default values for the "From Name", "From Email", so that you don't need to set these headers every time you want to send an email from your application.

You can also send a test mail from this panel to test everything is working.
 
Emails are tracked and automatically tagged for statistics within the Falconide Dashboard.
